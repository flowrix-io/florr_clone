/**
 * How far a bot can actually hit from, and how fast it actually moves.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this file exists
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A bot's whole combat controller is built on one number: the distance at which
 * its orbiting petals reach the mob it is fighting. `botManager` computed that
 * number three times over from hand-copied formulae —
 *
 *   getBotSpeedMod      a re-implementation of calculatePlayerModifiers().speed
 *   getBotRangeMod      a re-implementation of calculatePlayerModifiers().range
 *   computePetalReach   a re-implementation of the ring's orbit radius
 *
 * — and hand copies of a formula do not fail when they drift. They go on
 * returning a number. A bot whose reach estimate is 30px optimistic parks just
 * outside where its petals can connect and orbits a mob it never damages, for as
 * long as the server runs. No typecheck, self-test, harness or cutover oracle
 * can see that, because each of them exercises one side of the copy and the two
 * sides agree on nothing but their type.
 *
 * Since the petal cutover the orbit radius has a single owner: the ECS ring
 * (`ecs/systems/petalRing.ts`). `computeRingGeometry` derives `baseRadius` and
 * `defendOnlyBaseRadius`, and `petalOrbitTarget` turns those into an instance's
 * orbit point. So this module calls THAT, rather than reproducing it, and the
 * modifier aggregation comes from the real `calculatePlayerModifiers` (moved to
 * server/shared/playerModifiers.ts precisely so it could be called from here
 * without booting a server).
 *
 * The reach expression below is the only thing that is still spelled out rather
 * than called, because `petalOrbitTarget` answers "where is instance k right
 * now" and the controller needs "how far out can ANY instance ever get". They
 * are pinned to each other by `ecs/bench/bot_cutover_check.ts`, which sweeps the
 * orbit phase through a full revolution against the real ring and fails if the
 * farthest real orbit point ever escapes this bound — or if the bound drifts
 * loose enough to be useless.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Loadable without a server
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every import here is side-effect free. That is a requirement, not a
 * coincidence: the gate that pins this to the ring has to be able to require it,
 * and `server/playerManager.ts` — the obvious home for this code — transitively
 * imports petal_actions.ts and playerState.ts, both of which bind port 3000 and
 * open the account database at module scope.

 *   radius = (defendOnly ? defendOnlyBaseRadius : baseRadius)
 *            * ((stats.range ?? 1) * rangeModifier)
 *
 * plus, for a clumped petal, the `effectiveSize * 40 * 0.5` cluster offset that
 * `petalOrbitTarget` adds — worst case, since the offset points outward for one
 * instance of the clump on every revolution. The petal's own half-size is added
 * last, because reach is measured to the petal's far EDGE.
 *
 * Three things here are not in the formula it replaces, and each is a case where
 * the old copy was wrong rather than merely different:
 *
 *   - `defendOnly` petals (rose) do not extend while attacking, so their radius
 *     is capped at the neutral orbit. The old copy applied the attack extension
 *     to them and over-estimated a rose-heavy build's reach by ~60px.
 *   - clumped petals (sand) sit up to a cluster-offset further out than their
 *     slot centre; the old copy ignored it and UNDER-estimated.
 *   - the old copy took `max(radius multiplier)` and `max(half size)` over
 *     DIFFERENT petals and added them, which cannot describe any single petal.
 *     The max is now taken over each petal's own total.
 *
 * Only the primary ten slots are considered, matching `layoutPetalRing`: slots
 * 10+ are storage and never enter the ring. The old copy walked the whole array.
