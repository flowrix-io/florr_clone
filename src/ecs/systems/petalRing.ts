/**
 * The petal ring: orbit layout and kinematics.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE MODELLING DECISION: petal instances are NOT entities
 * ===========================================================================
 * The idiomatic ECS answer is one entity per petal instance, with a reference
 * back to the owning flower. That answer is wrong for THIS code, and the reason
 * is not taste — four concrete access patterns rule it out.
 *
 * 1. LIFETIME IS DERIVED, NOT EVENTED.
 *    Nothing ever "spawns a petal". The authoritative record of which instances
 *    exist is `player.loadout`, a legacy-owned array that a dozen sites REPLACE
 *    wholesale: equipping, the cooldown restore (which builds a brand-new Item
 *    object), PVP arena enter/exit, the maze rarity shift, splitter cloning,
 *    cross-server transfer, respawn. The instance list is recomputed from that
 *    array every tick by `layoutPetalRing` below. Entities would need a
 *    reconcile pass — the `reconcileEnemyEntities` shape — running for every
 *    player every tick over up to ~70 instances, with an archetype move (a full
 *    row copy plus a swap-remove) every time anyone touches their loadout.
 *    That is real per-tick churn bought to reproduce a keyed lookup.
 *
 * 2. HEALTH IS PER-SLOT, NOT PER-INSTANCE, FOR ALMOST EVERY PETAL.
 *    `getInstanceHealth`/`setInstanceHealth` fall through to `petal.health` —
 *    one shared number — unless the petal is `clumped` or `independentHealth`.
 *    A 5-count rose is five instances sharing one health pool and one cooldown;
 *    damage to any of them breaks all five. An entity-per-instance would either
 *    have no Health of its own (so the component that supposedly justifies the
 *    entity lives elsewhere) or hold a COPY of the slot's health — which is
 *    exactly the dual-representation shape that made mobs unkillable on the
 *    projectile cutover. The per-instance arrays that DO exist
 *    (`instanceHealth`, `instanceOnCooldown`, `instanceCooldownEndTime`) live
 *    on the loadout Item because the Item is persisted to the database and
 *    serialised across the cross-server portal; an entity cannot own state that
 *    has to survive leaving the process.
 *
 * 3. NOTHING QUERIES PETALS EXCEPT BY OWNER, IN SLOT ORDER.
 *    No spatial index contains petals — every petal-vs-X test is petal-driven
 *    (the petal queries the mob grid, the projectile bridge, the player map).
 *    No system iterates petals globally. Every single access is "for this
 *    flower, walk its instances in loadout order". Archetype iteration buys
 *    dense chunked iteration that has no consumer here, and its order is
 *    swap-remove order — neither stable nor owner-grouped.
 *
 * 4. THE BROADCAST NEEDS A DENSE PER-PLAYER ARRAY IN RING ORDER.
 *    `player.petalPositions` feeds a change-detection signature in
 *    tickBroadcast, so its ORDER and LENGTH are load-bearing. Rebuilding it
 *    bit-identically means walking the loadout in slot order — i.e. the
 *    derivation — not gathering scattered entities and sorting them back.
 *
 * So the flower is the entity and the ring is component data on it: `PetalRing`
 * (see components/petal.ts) carries a `PetalRingState`, and the orbit phase
 * lives in the `PlayerModifiers` column it always belonged in. The ECS owns the
 * KINEMATIC state (where each instance physically is, and how it got there);
 * the loadout Item keeps the state that has to outlive the process.
 *
 * Why the store is a Map of small structs rather than struct-of-arrays: the set
 * is at most ~70 entries per flower, it is never iterated densely (only point
 * looked-up by (loadoutIndex, instanceIndex)), and its indexing must stay
 * STABLE across loadout edits — equipping into slot 3 must not shift slot 5's
 * physics onto a different petal, which is precisely what a dense ring-ordered
 * layout would do. SoA's win is dense iteration; there is none to win here.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Two invariants this file exists to protect
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PREVIOUS-TICK PHASING. Every orbit position is measured from the flower's
 * PREVIOUS committed position, not its live one. That is why the geometry takes
 * `playerX`/`playerY` as explicit numbers instead of reading a Position column:
 * inside `updatePlayerState` the ECS-integrated position is parked in the
 * `movedX`/`movedY` staging pair and `player.x`/`player.y` still hold last
 * tick's commit, which is what makes petals trail the flower instead of
 * orbiting its live centre. Handing this module the entity would let it read
 * the wrong one.
 *
 * BIT-IDENTICAL POSITIONS. `petalPositions` is hashed for broadcast change
 * detection, so float drift here costs per-tick bandwidth forever. Every
 * expression below is a transcription of the code it replaced, in the same
 * association order, including the parts that look redundant (the `% (PI*2)` on
 * an angle that is about to go through cos/sin, the `* 2` that undoes a
 * historical 0.002 rad/ms rate, the separate `defendOnly` base radius). Do not
 * simplify them. `ecs/bench/petal_cutover_check.ts` asserts exact equality
 * against a verbatim copy of the legacy code and will fail on any algebraic
 * "cleanup".
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What is NOT here, and why
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Petal COMBAT (mob damage, poison, slow, knockback, projectile blocking, PVP,
 * the flower/bubble/yggdrasil specials), the break/cooldown/reload state
 * machine, the fields and auras, and the petal action VM all stay in
 * playerState.ts / petal_actions.ts. The reason is ordering, not effort: the
 * legacy loop INTERLEAVES kinematics and effects per instance, and instance k's
 * effects change instance k+1's kinematics — a kill removes an attraction
 * target, and (for a shared-health slot) damage to instance 0 makes instance 1
 * take the break path and emit no position at all. Batching all the kinematics
 * first would therefore change both the VALUES and the LENGTH of
 * `petalPositions`. So this module is stepped per instance, in the legacy
 * order, by the legacy loop — the same shape as `stepPlayerMovement`, which is
 * shared verbatim rather than reimplemented.
