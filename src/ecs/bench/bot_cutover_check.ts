/**
 * The oracle for the bot cutover.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this file exists
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Until this change nothing could drive `server/botManager.ts` at all. Requiring
 * it pulled `server/playerManager.ts` -> `server/utils.ts` -> `petal_actions.ts`
 * -> `server.ts`, which binds port 3000 and opens the account database at module
 * scope, so any gate that touched bots would have started a second live game
 * server on the port the real one is using. Three thousand lines of behaviour sat
 * behind that wall, and every claim about it was unverifiable. Breaking the wall
 * (the two lazy requires in botManager) is what makes this file possible, so the
 * first thing it checks is that the wall stays broken.
 *
 * What it then pins down is the pair of failures this cutover can produce that
 * are structurally invisible to the other four gates:
 *
 *  1. INPUT TIMING. Bots are producers into `player.inputs`, and the movement
 *     window consumes those inputs later in the same tick. `Phase.Input` on the
 *     MOB scheduler runs inside `moveEnemies()`, after `updatePlayerState` has
 *     already consumed them; on the PLAYER scheduler it runs after
 *     `syncPlayersToEcs` has already pushed the legacy object into
 *     `C.PlayerInput`. Either placement makes every bot act on a stale decision,
 *     and typechecking, the self-tests, the tick harness and the movement oracle
 *     are all blind to it — none of them has a bot, an AI pass and a movement
 *     window in the same process. So the order check below runs the REAL tick
 *     sequence and asserts the component the movement system read is the
 *     decision the AI made THIS tick, with a control that mis-places the input
 *     tick and requires the check to notice.
 *
 *  2. REACH DRIFT. A bot's whole combat controller is one number: how far its
 *     petals reach. That used to be a hand-copy of the ring's orbit radius and
 *     of `calculatePlayerModifiers`. A hand-copy does not fail when it drifts —
 *     it returns a number, the bot parks outside its own reach, and it orbits a
 *     mob it never damages for as long as the server runs. Nothing in the game
 *     reports it. So the reach check sweeps the orbit phase through a full
 *     revolution against the REAL ring (`layoutPetalRing`, `computeRingGeometry`,
 *     `petalOrbitTarget`) and requires `botPetalReach` to be both SOUND (never
 *     under the farthest real petal edge) and TIGHT (never more than a pixel
 *     over it) — a loose bound is just the old bug with a wider margin.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What is real here and what is a stand-in
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * REAL: `registerBotInputSystem`, `runtime.tickInput`, the whole of
 * `updateBotAI` including targeting, the oscillation watchdog, squad membership
 * and the loadout swaps; `rebuildEnemyGrid`/`queryEnemiesNear`; `syncPlayersToEcs`,
 * `runtime.tickPlayers`, `syncPlayersFromEcs`; `botPetalReach` and the petal ring.
 * The legacy `players` and `enemies` singletons are the actual module
 * singletons botManager reads; drops are read from this bench's world through
 * the item registry.
 *
 * STAND-IN: the socket server (a recording stub — bots emit chat and squad
 * updates), and the one line of `updatePlayerState` that commits the staging
 * pair back onto `player.x/y`. Bot CREATION and REMOVAL are deliberately not
 * exercised: `createBot` needs the spawn-position machinery and `removeBot`
 * lazily requires petal_actions, and both of those are exactly the modules that
 * boot a server. The final `assertNoServerBooted` is what would catch the tick
 * path ever reaching one of them.

 * Reach cases, and why every CONTROL loadout holds only the petal under test.
 *
 * Reach is a MAXIMUM over the ring, so one ordinary petal can hide any of the
 * three bugs. `basic` at rare is size 2 — a 40px half-size orbiting at the full
 * attack radius — which out-reaches a rose (capped at the neutral radius) and
 * exactly matches a sand clump (radius + 20px cluster offset + 20px half-size).
 * Pair either flagged petal with a single basic and the old formula agrees with
 * the real ring to the pixel. That is precisely how this drift survived in the
 * live game: it only bites builds where the flagged petal IS the outermost thing
 * the flower has.
 *
 * So each control equips two copies of the flagged petal and nothing else, and
 * the masked pairing is kept beside it as a NON-control case — `botPetalReach`
 * still has to be exact there, it just cannot prove anything about the old
 * formula, and marking it `legacyWasWrong` would make the control assertion fire
 * on a build where everything is correct.
