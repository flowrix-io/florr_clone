## Quick start

Requires Node.js 22+

```bash
npm install
npm run build   # builds cpp, webpacks the client, compresses bundle
npm start       # compiles the server and runs dist/server.js
```

Open `https://localhost:3000`.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run build` | Build cpp module, bundle client (production), compress bundle |
| `npm run build:server` | TypeScript compile of the server only |
| `npm run build:client` | TypeScript compile of the client only |
| `npm start` | Build server and run `dist/server.js` |
| `npm run dev` | Webpack dev watch |
| `npm run dev:server` | Run server under `ts-node-dev` |

### Biomes

The world is divided into biomes (ocean, desert, jungle, etc.) with their own mobs, rarities, and scaling. Biome maps are created in `MapEditor.html` and loaded from JSON (see `map.json`, `example_biome_map.json`).

### Rarities

`common`, `uncommon`, `rare`, `epic`, `legendary`, `mythic`, `ultra`, `super`, `unique` and `apex`.

## Features

- **Multiplayer** via raw WebSockets, with cross-server portals for transferring between server instances(server transfer disabled in default map)
- **Biome system** with per-biome mob pools, spawners, and scaling
- **Petal crafting** across the rarity ladder
- **Guilds & squads**, chat, and a leaderboard
- **PvP arena** with dedicated spawner and rendering
- **Bots** for populating servers
- **Daily streak** rewards and a tutorial flow for new players
- **Map editor** (`MapEditor.html`) for authoring biome layouts
- **Persistence** via custom JSON database
- **HTTPS** support (drop `cert.crt` / `cert.key` at the project root)

## Chat commands

Players:

- `/help` — list available commands
- `/list_all`, `/list_common`, `/list_uncommon`, `/list_rare`, `/list_epic`, `/list_legendary`, `/list_mythic`, `/list_ultra`, `/list_super`, `/list_unique` — list mobs of the given rarity

Chat accepts limited inline HTML: `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<span style="color:…">`, `<blink>`.

## Admin

Flag a user as admin by setting `"admin": true` on their record in `dist/inventory.json` (or the SQLite row). Admins can run server commands from chat with `/admin <cmd>` or `/cmd <cmd>`. Non-admins attempting admin commands get "Command does not exist". All admin invocations are logged server-side.

### Server console / admin commands

Typed on the server's stdin, or via `/admin` in chat:

- `save` / `save <playerId>` — persist player progress
- `list-players`, `list-sockets` — enumerate connections
- `spawn <mobType> <rarity> [x y]` — spawn a mob (e.g. `spawn hornet legendary 1000 2000`)
- `spawn_special_mobs` — spawn ultra/super/unique tiers
- `set_max_enemies <n>` — cap concurrent enemy count

Mob types include: `bee`, `hornet`, `mantis`, `ladybug`, `soldier_ant`, `leafbug`, `bush`, `target_dummy`, `item_spawner`. See `src/mobs.ts` for the current list.
