// Registration and login abuse limits.
//
// Someone spam-created over 9000 accounts against the production browser
// server, which had no limit of any kind on account creation. This is the same
// defence, on this side: see src/server/accountLimiter.ts -- the constants and
// the layering are deliberately identical, so an operator reasoning about one
// server is reasoning about both.
//
// The per-session budget in session.h does NOT cover this. A session is a
// socket, and a socket is free: reconnecting hands the client a brand-new
// allowance, so a per-session counter bounds how fast ONE connection may try
// and says nothing about how many accounts a client may create. These limits
// are keyed on the address instead, and outlive any one connection.
//
// Three layers, each covering the others' blind spot:
//   * a per-address token bucket -- the shape of a real player's behaviour;
//   * a persisted 24h per-address cap, so a restart does not hand an attacker
//     a fresh allowance (Database::countAccountsCreatedBy);
//   * a global bucket, keyed on nothing the client controls, as the backstop
//     for an address that cannot be trusted.
