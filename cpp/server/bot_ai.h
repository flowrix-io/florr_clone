// What a bot decides, and what it has to remember to decide it.
//
// The controller itself is server/bot_ai.cpp -- GameServer methods, in the
// same way server/chat_commands.cpp holds the console, because the decision
// path reads the terrain, the map's annotation layer, the broadphase, the drop
// list, the squad roster and the chat channel, and threading six services
// through a free-standing class would only move the coupling.
//
// This header holds the three things that have to be VISIBLE from
// game_server.h: the per-bot memory, the pathfinder's reusable scratch, and
// the tuning.
//
// THE SHAPE OF THE CONTROLLER, and why it is this shape
// -----------------------------------------------------
// A bot is not a decision tree evaluated from scratch every tick. That is what
// it used to be, and the trouble with it is that every individual branch can
// be right while the behaviour they add up to is wrong: a bot re-derives its
// destination thirty times a second, the answer wobbles between two equally
// good options, and what a player sees is a flower pacing.
//
// So the controller is an ACTIVITY MACHINE. A bot is doing exactly one thing
// at a time (BotActivity), it stays in it for at least a dwell period, and it
// leaves only on a reason strong enough to be worth interrupting what it was
// doing. Under that sits one sensing pass per tick (BotSenses) that every
// activity reads from, so the decision and the steering always agree about
// what is in the world.
//
// Two rules everything below serves:
//
//   * A BOT FIGHTS WHAT IS IN FRONT OF IT. There is no state a bot can be in
//     where it walks through a mob without engaging it. Travelling, roaming,
//     regrouping -- all of them yield to something close enough to hit, which
//     is what stops bots shouldering through a field of mobs untouched.
//   * A BOT BELONGS TO A BIOME. The population is spread evenly over every
//     biome the title screen offers, and a bot never leaves the one it was
//     born in -- pads refuse them. So every terrain question, every
//     broadphase query and every per-tick index below is asked about THAT
//     bot's realm: two maps' coordinates overlap exactly, and a question
//     asked of the wrong one answers about a place the bot is not standing.
//   * A BOT STAYS WHERE THE GAME IS. Ambient mobs are stocked around HUMANS
//     (game_server.h: humanPlayers_), so ground with nobody on it has nothing
//     living on it. A bot that walks to the far side of the map to farm is a
//     bot that stands in an empty field forever, which is precisely what it
//     used to do. Hunting grounds are therefore chosen around the people who
//     are online, spread out around them rather than stacked on them.

/// Total flowers the world aims to hold, bots plus humans.

/// than two dozen in whichever one a player happens to open on. That is the
/// deliberate trade -- five biomes that used to hold nobody at all now hold
/// somebody, and the one at the front holds fewer.
///
/// THE COST IS IN THE BANDS, NOT IN THE BOTS. A bot is a fraction of a
/// millisecond of tick, but it is also an OBSERVER, and an observer inside a
/// spawn band wakes that band and stocks the whole of it. So the curve is a
/// step, not a slope. Measured with tools/bot_probe over sixty simulated
/// seconds on the shipped maps, against the old one-biome population as 1.0x:
///
///     10 bots, 6 biomes   ~540 mobs   0.87x

///     18 bots, 6 biomes   ~730 mobs   1.12x
///     23 bots, 6 biomes   ~790 mobs   1.23x
