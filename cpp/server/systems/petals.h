// The petal ring: spawning it, placing it, breaking it and reloading it.
//
// The two components below carry this system's state and both live on the
// PLAYER, never on a petal. A broken slot has no petal entity left, so state
// kept there would be destroyed by the very event that has to be remembered --
// the break -- and the reload timer would go with it.
//
// Every number the ring uses comes out of the content registry as PetalStats.
// Nothing here re-derives a stat from a rarity: that ladder is rarity.h's job,
// and a second copy of it is how the two drift apart.
