#pragma once
// Mob intent: what every wild mob and every summoned pet decides to do this
// tick.
//
// The system belongs to the INTENT phase and writes exactly two things -- the
// mob's velocity for this tick (Motion::velocity) and where it points
// (Transform::angle). Positions belong to the movement phase, which integrates
// that velocity as it stands, applies knockback and pushes the body out of
// walls.
//
// The velocity is published RAW rather than eased toward, because the
// reference server has no acceleration model for a mob: a chase is a fixed
// step at the mob's speed, and an idle mob runs the gardn stop-and-go machine,
// which carries its own friction, its own clamp and its own drift store
// (PassiveMotion::velocity). Easing either of those a second time is an
// invented acceleration that shortens every hop and every pursuit. There is
// one deliberate exception, at placeFollower(): a centipede's trailing segment
// has no motion of its own, its place is a CONSTRAINT on the segment ahead of
// it, and expressing a constraint as a velocity leaves the chain permanently a
// tick behind and visibly elastic.
//
// Damage is not this file's business either. A mob that reaches its target
// stamps MobAi::lastAttackMillis; the combat system reads the overlap and
// applies ContactDamage. Two systems that can both hurt the same player in one
// tick is how a mob ends up dealing double damage on the tick it arrives. A
// volley is the exception and belongs here, because WHEN a mob shoots is a
// decision and the shot is aimed along the pre-move bearing to the target.
// Damage is READ, though: what turns a neutral mob on a player is its damage
// ledger growing, since over there every source funnels through one credit
// call, while the hurt flash is lit by direct hits alone and is otherwise
// purely something to look at.
//
// What shapes the rest is the cost model. A 60000-unit world holds thousands
// of mobs and a few dozen players, so the two gates below are not tuning, they
// are the reason the tick fits its budget:
//
//   LOD      a mob further than kMobActiveRadius from every active player
//            thinks once every kMobFarStride ticks instead of every tick, and
//            holds still on the ticks in between. It is not frozen: it
//            simulates at a fifth of the rate, which is what stops the far
//            world draining into wall lines while nobody is looking at it. The
//            one thing that keeps full rate out there is the idle drift, which
//            carries no gate in the reference either. The caller supplies the
//            player positions, so a region with nobody in it costs one
//            distance test per mob.
//   CADENCE  every mob near a player runs its whole brain every tick,
//            acquisition included -- that is what the reference pays, and a
//            mob that scans on a timer ignores a player who walked into its
//            range for as long as the timer says. LOD, not a clock, is what
//            bounds the cost. The one genuinely periodic heading left, a
//            sandstorm's, keeps a clock of its own rather than a shared one:
//            it re-rolls three times a second, which is far faster than
//            anything else here would want to re-decide.
//
// Pets get their own pass rather than being fed through the wild-mob one: a
// summoned mob follows its owner, pops back to them when a wall breaks line of
// sight, and is retired when it drifts off their screen. None of that is "wild
// mob with a different target list".
