// What a dead mob leaves behind, and who is allowed to take it.
//
// A drop is a real entity: it sits on the ground, it is replicated, it expires,
// and it is picked up by walking over it. That last part is the whole reason
// magnetism is a RADIUS and not a pull force -- dragging the item into the
// player consumes it before any snapshot ever carried it, and the client is
// left with nothing to animate.
//
// Eligibility exists so that killing a mob is worth doing. Only the ranked
// contributors see a normal mob drop, and each of them may collect it once.
