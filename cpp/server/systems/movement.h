// The movement phase: velocity in, position out, for everything that moves.
//
// Players are the reason this file is careful. The client predicts its own
// flower with desiredVelocity() and integrateVelocity() out of constants.h,
// and the server authorises it with the SAME two functions -- so in open
// movement the two agree bit for bit and nothing visibly corrects. Any
// shortcut taken here that the client does not take is a rubber-band.
//
// Everything else -- mobs, projectiles -- shares the collision half of that
// path and differs only in where its velocity came from.
