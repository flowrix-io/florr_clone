// Combat: every path in the game that removes health, and the death that
// follows.
//
// The whole point of this file is that there is exactly ONE function that
// writes Health::current -- applyDamage(). Invulnerability, the same-team
// refusal, the hurt flash, the contribution ledger, the damage event and the
// transition to Dead are consequences of a hit, and a consequence that lives
// in only one place cannot be forgotten by the next damage source somebody
// adds. No other system may touch Health::current; it should reach for
// applyDamage instead.
//
// STRUCTURAL TRAP: applyDamage() adds the Dead tag, which relocates the victim
// between archetypes and invalidates every column pointer a Query::each is
// holding. It must therefore never be called from inside each(). Every pass
// below is written as gather-then-apply for exactly this reason, and any
// system that wants to deal damage must do the same.
