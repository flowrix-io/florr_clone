// Populating the two realms that are not an authored map.
//
// spawning.h populates a MAP, and it does it from the spawn bands its author
// drew: ground no band covers grows nothing there. That rule cannot reach the
// arena or the maze, because neither is authored -- both are GENERATED, they
// carry no object layer, and there is nowhere to draw a band. They are bounded
// rooms, and the reference populates them WHOLE
// (src/server/pvpArenaSpawner.ts, src/server/mazeSpawner.ts): the arena holds
// a fixed crowd that scales with the flowers fighting in it, and the maze
// carries the reference density across every corridor at once, so exploring
// deeper always finds something rather than a bubble around wherever the
// player happened to walk in.
//
// So this system is deliberately exempt from "no band, no mobs". If a realm
// here ever became a hand-authored map, its population would move to bands and
// this file would stop covering it.
//
// This system decides WHAT goes WHERE and WHEN; building the entity is still
// SpawnSystem::spawnMob's job, which is what keeps a maze mob the same object
// an overworld one is -- same components, same drops, same AI. The mobs it
// makes carry AmbientMob like any other, and SpawnSystem's census keeps them
// for as long as anyone is in their realm, then lets them drain.
