// Keeping the world populated: what appears, where, and what is recycled.
//
// A 60000x60000 map cannot hold a full population. What is simulated instead
// is a moving neighbourhood: mobs appear inside each player's buffered
// viewport, and a mob nobody has
// been near for long enough is recycled. The map is dense exactly where
// someone is looking and empty everywhere else, so the tick cost scales with
// the number of players rather than with the area of the world.
//
// Two ceilings sit above that. A per-section cap keeps one biome from being
// stripped to feed another, and a global cap keeps a crowd of players from
// multiplying the population without bound -- twenty players standing apart
// each want their own neighbourhood, and without the cap they would get it.
