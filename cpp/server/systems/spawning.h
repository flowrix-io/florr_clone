// Keeping the world populated: what exists, where, and what is simulated.
//
// THE AUTHOR DRAWS WHERE THE MOBS ARE. A map carries SPAWN BANDS -- shapes on
// an object layer, each with a `difficulty` -- and a band owns a population of
// its own, sized by the area of its outline. That is the only source of
// ambient mobs there is. Ground with no band over it grows nothing, ever, so a
// map its author has drawn no band on has no mobs at all: that is a fact about
// the data, not a fault in this file, and the map's load line says so out loud
// when it happens.
//
// THE WHOLE MAP IS ALWAYS STOCKED. Every band holds its full population at all
// times, whether or not anybody is looking at it, so walking into a corner
// nobody has been to for an hour is walking into a full band rather than into
// an empty one that starts filling as you arrive.
//
// What makes that affordable is that a stocked mob is NOT AN ENTITY. A band's
// population is held as LatentMob records -- a position, a type and a tier,
// and nothing else -- and a record becomes a real entity only when somebody's
// viewport reaches it (promoteLatent), and goes back to being a record when
// nobody has been near it for the grace period (takeCensus). So the number of
// mobs the tick SIMULATES follows the number of players, exactly as it did
// when the far side of the map was simply empty, while the number of mobs the
// world CONTAINS follows its area. A latent mob costs one small struct and one
// distance test per population pass; it is in no query, no archetype, no
// broadphase and no snapshot.
//
// Two rules keep that population EVEN rather than merely correct in total. A
// mob nobody has been near goes back to being a record where it stands, not
// where the band would next have sampled; and a mob that was KILLED has its
// slot handed back within kRespawnScatter of where it died, after a short
// wait. Without the second one a player farming one corner of a band strips it
// while the far side of the same band quietly goes over density -- and the map
// reports itself full the whole time, which is the hardest kind of wrong to
// see.
//
// The exceptions are BOSSES -- super and above -- and the target dummies.
// Both are placed live and stay live wherever they stand, however long nobody
// looks at them. A boss is an EVENT: chat is told the moment one appears, the
// bot controller is told with it, and it waits where it spawned until
// something kills it.
//
// One ceiling sits above all of it -- a global cap on LIVE mobs, so a crowd of
// players spread over many bands cannot multiply the simulated population
// without bound. The latent population needs no such cap: it is the map's own
// area times a density.
//
// The ARENA and the MAZE are not map ground: they are generated, they carry no
// object layer and no band covers them, and ModeSpawner (mode_spawning.h)
// populates each one whole, with live entities. Nothing in this file stocks
// them, and nothing in them is ever latent.
