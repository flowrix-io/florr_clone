// Squads: the four-flower party the browser build's `/squad` commands make.
//
// A squad is a conversation, not a record. It lives in memory, it is keyed by
// the CONNECTION rather than by the account, and nothing about it survives a
// restart -- exactly as src/server/squadManager.ts holds it. Split out of
// GameServer because every rule in here ("only the leader may invite", "an
// invite lapses after thirty seconds", "the leader leaving promotes the next
// member") is testable without a socket, and because two roads reach it: the
// `/squad-*` chat commands, and the guild panel's own squad buttons.
//
// Members are named by SquadMemberId rather than by entity: a human's body is
// destroyed and rebuilt on every death, and a party that lost its members each
// time somebody died would not be a party. A bot has no connection, so it is
// named by the one thing it does have, its body.
