// What a bot does.
//
// server/bot_ai.h carries the tuning and explains the shape; this is the
// behaviour. One tick of one bot, in order:
//
//   sense  ->  update the hunting ground  ->  unjam  ->  choose an activity
//   ->  run it
//
// The sensing pass is one broadphase query, and every decision below is
// answered out of it. That is not only cheaper than the four queries this used
// to run: it is what makes the targeting and the steering agree. The old
// controller filtered mobs out of its target search that its steering still
// pushed away from, and the gap between those two lists is precisely where a
// bot ends up shouldering through a field of mobs without ever hitting one.
//
// Everything a bot writes is its PlayerInput, which the ordinary player
// movement and petal pipeline then consumes. No system anywhere else knows a
// bot exists, which is the whole reason a bot is a plain player entity.
