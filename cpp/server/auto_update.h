// The `update` admin command's engine: fetch the latest build and install it
// over the running one.
//
// The pipeline is the TypeScript server's (src/server/autoUpdate.ts, in git
// history at d47055a7), unchanged in shape because the thing it installs is
// unchanged: `dist/` is committed to the repository, so the branch zipball IS
// the build, and `dist/inventory.json` is gitignored, so the archive can never
// contain a database. Steps:
//
//   1. Back up the database. MANDATORY, and done by the caller before any of
//      this is started -- a failure there aborts before a file is touched.
//   2. Download the zipball.
//   3. Unzip into a staging directory (GitHub wraps everything in one
//      "<repo>-<branch>/" folder, which is why the build is searched for).
//   4. Overlay it onto the directory the server is running from. inventory.json
//      and node_modules are never overwritten -- the first is the live
//      database, the second holds that host's own install of the optional
//      WebTransport packages (@fails-components/webtransport and its native
//      QUIC backend). db_backups/, cert.crt and cert.key are left alone too.
//   5. Schedule a restart, which is what actually loads the new build.
//
// Only the Node build can do any of this, and that is not a limitation: the
// zipball carries `dist/server.js` and `dist/server.wasm`, which is exactly
// what `npm start` runs. A native binary is not in it, so a native server has
// nothing to install and says so rather than pretending.
