#pragma once
// The account database: accounts, login sessions, and per-player progress,
// persisted as one JSON file.
//
// The file is `inventory.json` in the shape the old TypeScript server wrote,
// because live player data exists in that shape and nothing here is allowed to
// invalidate it. Two consequences run through the whole implementation:
//
//  * Fields this build does not model are NOT dropped. Every record carries an
//    `extra` object holding the keys we do not understand, and they are
//    written back out untouched. A rewrite that quietly ate the maze
//    progression on first save would be worse than no rewrite at all.
//
//  * A file that exists but does not parse is fatal for writes, not for
//    startup reads. Overwriting a corrupt database with our empty default
//    converts a problem an operator can recover from into total account loss.
//
// Key order is preserved on the round trip. `Json` keeps insertion order and
// the tables below keep theirs, so a save produces a file that diffs cleanly
// against the one it was loaded from instead of reshuffling every account.
