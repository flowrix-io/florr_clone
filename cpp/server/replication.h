// Per-client snapshot construction.
//
// Each client sees only what is near it, and is told about an entity in three
// stages: a SPAWN record carrying the immutable facts (kind, type, rarity,
// name), then per-tick UPDATE records carrying only the fields that changed,
// then a REMOVE when it leaves view or dies.
//
// Removals are derived, not evented: every tick the replicator diffs what the
// client is believed to know against what is actually in view. There is no
// one-shot "this entity went away" message that can be dropped and leave a
// permanent ghost -- the diff regenerates the removal for as long as the
// discrepancy exists.
