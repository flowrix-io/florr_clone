// Per-connection state: the handshake, authentication, and the link between a

// A connection is deliberately NOT a player. It exists from the moment a
// socket opens; it acquires an account at login and a body at join, and it can
// drop the body (back to the title screen) without losing the account. Keeping
// those three lifetimes separate is what makes "leave to menu" and "reconnect"
// ordinary operations rather than special cases.
