// How the client turns a 20 Hz snapshot stream into display-rate motion.
//
// This is a port of the browser build's model (src/ecs/client/interpolation.ts),
// which is itself gardn's. The two rules that matter, and why:
//
//  * FLOWERS ARE NEVER PREDICTED. Every flower -- the viewer's included --
//    eases toward the authoritative position at one fixed, frame-rate
//    independent rate. The client runs no movement simulation of its own, so
//    there is nothing to reconcile and nothing to snap back.
//
//    This client used to predict locally and reconcile on every snapshot, and
//    it is exactly the model the browser build removed. Two things make it
//    jitter badly here. The prediction integrated velocity with no terrain
//    collision at all, so walking into a wall meant predicting straight
//    through it and being yanked back on every snapshot. And the camera is
//    pinned to the flower, so a correction of any size does not nudge the
//    flower -- it jolts the whole world.
//
//    The cost is input latency of about half a round trip plus the ease time
//    constant. That is the trade the browser build makes on purpose.
//
//  * MOBS ARE PLAYED BACK ON A DELAY, flowers are not. A mob carries a short
//    sample history and is rendered `kMobRenderDelayMillis` behind the render
//    clock, which absorbs jitter and packet loss. Flowers get no buffer,
//    because a buffered remote flower visibly lags the local one and the whole
//    point of the shared ease is that every flower moves alike.
//
// Facing follows the same split. A flower's angle comes straight off the wire
// -- it drives the eyes, and easing it makes the pupils swim. A mob's angle is
// eased rather than interpolated from the history: passive AI turns up to 180
// degrees in one server step, and interpolating that whips the mob through the
// whole turn inside a single sample interval.
