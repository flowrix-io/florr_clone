// World <-> screen mapping.
//
// Two decisions here look wrong in isolation and are not.
//
//  * Zoom is flat. `Graphics.zoomLevel` (src/graphics/core.ts) is 1.0 -- the
//    player's zoom setting times whatever a petal asks for -- and the world
//    transform is nothing but ctx.scale(zoomLevel, zoomLevel)
//    (src/graphics/render.ts). This camera keeps that, and it is NOT what
//    stops the game zooming out when the window is resized: the viewport it
//    is handed is in DESIGN units, not pixels, so it spans at most the same
//    1920x1080 of world at every window size and on every display -- exactly
//    that at 16:9, and less on the short axis of any other shape. The scale
//    that absorbs the window's real size is a single base transform on the
//    whole frame (see kDesignWidth in client/app.cpp), applied to the world
//    and the HUD together.
//
//    That togetherness is the point. This camera did once scale its own zoom
//    by viewportHeight/1080, and it shrank every world-unit metric in the
//    renderer to 0.667x at 720p while the HUD, which knew nothing about it,
//    stayed put. A camera cannot fix a window size on its own; only something
//    above both layers can.
//
//  * The camera is pinned to the flower, never eased toward it. src/game.ts's
//    updateCamera writes the camera straight from the flower's *drawn*
//    position each frame, so the flower sits exactly on the screen centre.
//    That is load-bearing: the mouse control law reads the cursor's offset
//    from the screen centre and treats it as the offset from the flower, so a
//    lagging camera would skew steering, not just drift the flower off centre.
