// The mobs whose picture is CODE rather than a document.
//
// Almost every sprite in the game is an inline SVG in mobs.json, compiled once
// and fitted into whatever box a call site asks for (see sprites.h). That works
// because almost every mob is ONE size: the document is drawn at the radius the
// mob happens to have and nothing about the picture depends on how big that is.
//
// A handful of mobs are not one size. A cactus spawns anywhere from 30 to 60
// units across, a rock grows a tier at a time, a sandstorm jitters between two
// bounds -- and a fitted document answers that by magnifying, which is exactly
// what it must not do. A rock twice as wide is not a rock photographed closer:
// it has MORE facets, cut the same size. A bigger cactus grows more spines, not
// longer ones. gardn draws those mobs by generating their geometry from the
// radius every frame, and this is that code, ported: the vertex counts come out
// of `radius`, the spine and the outline widths do not.
//
// The scorpion, the crab and the spider are here for the other reason --
// their claws and legs move with a walk phase, which a static document cannot
// do.
//
// The leech is here for a third reason. Its body is not a row of beads, it is
// one smooth tube, and the reference draws it by stroking a single polyline
// through every segment's centre. Our renderer draws one entity at a time and
// no entity knows its neighbours -- but a segment is turned to FACE its
// leader and held exactly `kSegmentSpacingPerRadius` radii from it, so each
// one can paint the joint between itself and the one in front and let the
// union of those bars be the tube. No document can express that, because the
// length of the bar is a fact about the chain rather than about the picture.
//
// Every painter draws about the ORIGIN, in WORLD units, with the body's radius
// equal to the `radius` it is handed: a caller that wants it on screen scales
// and translates first, exactly as it would around a fitted document. Nothing
// here reads the clock, the camera, or the entity -- a painter is a pure
// function of the attributes it is given, which is what lets the world, the
// bestiary and a contact sheet all call it and get the same picture.
