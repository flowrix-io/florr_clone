// Compiled artwork: mobs, petals, and the tiles a map is painted with.
//
// Almost every sprite in the game is an inline SVG document inside mobs.json /
// petals.json. Those are parsed ONCE at startup into retained SvgDocuments and
// drawn straight to the canvas thereafter -- there is no bitmap bake. Baking
// mobs to bitmaps was tried in the original and cost more than it saved: a
// rarity-scaled mob needs a bitmap per size, the cache thrashes as soon as a
// crowd is on screen, and the vector path is fast enough.
//
// The exceptions are the mobs whose `image` names a PAINTER rather than
// declaring a document -- `$rock`, `$cactus` -- because their picture is a
// function of their radius and a document can only be magnified. This cache
// resolves that marker once at build time and dispatches to mob_art.h, so
// every call site keeps one way to draw a mob whichever kind it is.
//
// The map tiles are the same idea one step out, but their palette is the
// MAP's, not this file's: a Tiled tileset names one artwork per tile, the
// build stages `maps/tiles/` flat into the data directory, and this cache
// loads one by bare file name the first time a map asks for it. Nothing here
// ever builds a file name, and nothing here knows what a tile MEANS -- which
// edge or corner picture belongs in a cell was decided by the author's
// terrain brush and is in the map file already.
