// Compiled artwork: mobs, petals, and the ground the world is tiled with.
//
// Every sprite in the game is an inline SVG document inside mobs.json /
// petals.json. Those are parsed ONCE at startup into retained SvgDocuments and
// drawn straight to the canvas thereafter -- there is no bitmap bake. Baking
// mobs to bitmaps was tried in the original and cost more than it saved: a
// rarity-scaled mob needs a bitmap per size, the cache thrashes as soon as a
// crowd is on screen, and the vector path is fast enough.
//
// The biome ground and the textured map tiles are the same idea one step out:
// a document per map section, tiled across the world by the renderer.
