    // paints shut every passage narrower than the cell it runs through. With

    // shading would save it either. The authored rings are exact, the
    // rasteriser anti-aliases them for free, and a gap appears on the minimap
    // because the geometry genuinely has one.
    //
    // eachMinimapSolid() is what decides WHICH solids and in what order: every
    // ring once, whatever cells it is filed under, bottom layer first. See
    // minimap.h.
    //
    // ONE PATH PER RUN, not a fill per ring. Two rings that share an edge each
    // cover about half of the pixels along it, and half painted over half is
    // three quarters, not solid: filled one at a time, a wall mass comes out
    // hatched with pale seams along every tile boundary -- which is exactly the
    // "there is a tunnel there" the minimap must not invent. A nonzero fill of
    // equally wound contours is precisely their union, and its coverage is
    // computed over the union, so a batched path has seams nowhere and the true
    // edges everywhere. (The rasteriser's own stroker leans on the same
    // identity; see strokeOutline in third_party/cpp_canvas.) So the run is
    // broken only where the COLOUR changes going up the layer stack, which on
    // every map shipped here is once: water, then everything above it. A wall
    // layer and a castle layer above it are one fill and one silhouette.
    //
    // Walls are one black silhouette whatever kind of wall they are -- castle,
    // dirt, a boulder -- because the shape is what a player reads a minimap
    // for. WATER is the exception: it blocks like a wall (tileBlocks() is true
    // of it) but it is the one blocker the map format still distinguishes, and
    // a river drawn in the same black as a castle turns a recognisable
    // coastline into a blob. The tileset's `water` tag exists for exactly this
    // and for nothing else -- it never decides whether a shape blocks, only
    // what kind of blocker it is.
