// The bestiary.
//
// A row per mob, a column per tier, and a cell filled in only once the account
// has actually killed one. The empty cells are the point: the grid is a
// checklist of the world, and the gaps are what is left to find.
//
// Every mob is generated at every tier, so no cell is ever "this mob does not
// exist here": an unkilled cell is a bare plate in the card's own frame colour,
// which is what makes a part-filled row read at a glance. Hovering one that HAS
// been killed opens a tooltip carrying the full drop table: the same
// upgrade/downgrade pipeline the server rolls, run forwards and displayed as
// per-rarity percentages.
