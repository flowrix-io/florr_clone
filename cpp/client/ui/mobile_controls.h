// The touch HUD: a virtual stick for movement and aim, and the two buttons
// that stand in for the keys a phone does not have.
//
// A port of the browser build's src/graphics/mobile-controls.ts, control for
// control, with one thing done differently and one thing added.
//
// Differently: the sizes. The reference is written in CSS pixels on a canvas
// the size of the viewport, so its 55px stick radius is a thumb on a phone and
// a dot on a desktop monitor. This client draws into a FIXED 1920x1080 design
// space (see Window's header), where a size is a fraction of the screen rather
// than a length -- so every measurement below is the reference's, multiplied
// by the design units a CSS pixel is worth on a phone-sized viewport. The
// controls then land at the same fraction of the screen a phone player sees
// there, which is what the reference's numbers were chosen for.
//
// Added: aim. The reference aims at the mouse even on a phone, where "the
// mouse" is wherever the last tap happened to land. Here a deflected stick
// aims as well as moves, which is the only thing a thumb can say.
