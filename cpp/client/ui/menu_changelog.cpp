// The changelog overlay: what changed, newest release first.
//
// An overlay rather than one of the tall list panels -- it hangs under the top
// icon row at a fixed 600x500, which is why its bounds come from
// `ChangelogPanel::bounds` and not from the shared list anchor.
//
// The table below is the browser build's CHANGELOG array, verbatim and in its
// own order -- oldest first -- and is walked backwards to paint. Keeping the
// source order means a new release is appended here exactly as it is appended
// there, with nothing to re-sort and no way to get the order wrong twice.
//
// Row pitch is written as literals rather than derived from lineHeight(): the
// reference advances 25px under a date and 24px under a bullet whatever the
// face's own leading is, and deriving it would put every row of a 7896px list
// a little further out of place than the row above it.
