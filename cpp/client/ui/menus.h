#pragma once
// The game's menus: inventory, crafting, talents, bestiary, shop, skins,
// leaderboard and settings.
//
// One menu is open at a time. That is a deliberate rule rather than a
// limitation: every panel is anchored to the same place, they overlap, and a
// stack of them would leave the player dragging petals into a panel they
// cannot see. Opening one closes whatever was open, exactly as pressing its
// key again closes it.
//
// The panels are immediate-mode. Each one lays itself out, hit-tests, acts and
// draws in a single pass, so there is no retained widget tree to leave stale
// and no second copy of the layout for the input pass to drift away from. What
// they DO keep between frames is genuinely stateful: a scroll offset, what is
// being dragged, how far an animation has run.
