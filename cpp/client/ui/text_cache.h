// The native build's stand-in for a browser's glyph cache.
//
// A browser keeps rasterized glyphs and reuses them; this client hands the
// rasterizer a freshly built Path2D of contours for every run, every frame,
// and then STROKES it as well as filling it. Measured in a game frame, that
// was half the frame -- and four fifths of it was the stroke pass, whose
// outline over a whole run puts hundreds of crossings on every scanline for
// the coverage walk to sort.
//
// So a run that has been drawn once is kept as the pixels it produced, keyed
// by everything that decides those pixels, and blitted next time. See
// paintRunCached for what "everything" is and why the key can be finite.
