// Selecting the text a panel has already painted.
//
// The menus are immediate-mode: a label is a draw call and nothing retains
// where it landed, so there is nothing for a selection to point at. This layer
// records every run of STATIC text as it is painted and resolves a drag
// against that list, which is what lets a player highlight a petal's stats, a
// changelog line or somebody's chat message and copy it.
//
// Capture is OFF by default and is turned on for exactly two things: an open
// menu panel and the chat transcript. Inside those, the widgets that print a
// label on something you click -- a button, a chip, an item tile, a text field
// -- turn it back off, because that text belongs to the control rather than to
// the page. Everything that moves is outside both scopes to begin with: the
// world, the HUD, damage numbers and the loadout bar are never recorded.
