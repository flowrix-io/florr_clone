// The star shop.
//
// Three tabs over one card: the store's ten rotating offers, the challenges
// that pay the stars to buy them with, and the code redeemer. The store is the
// panel -- a fixed two rows of five cards that change on the hour, each a
// petal tile over a gold price pill, some of them wearing a discount ribbon --
// and the other two tabs are what feeds it.
//
// Laid out against a reference screenshot rather than against the browser
// build's CSS, which is why the numbers here are literal pixel offsets from
// the card's own edges: they were measured off that shot at its own size, and
// the panel is drawn at that size.
//
// The offers themselves are not this file's: `shopOffers` in shared/game/shop.h
// derives them from the clock, and the server derives the same ten to price
// what is clicked. This panel only draws them and names which one was pressed.
