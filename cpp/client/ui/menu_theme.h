// Every menu in the game is the same object -- a rounded card in a saturated
// colour, a darker border of the same hue, white outlined text -- and is told
// apart by that colour alone. A player learns "blue is my petals, tan is the
// forge, yellow is the bestiary" long before they read a title, so the colours
// are the identity and belong in one table rather than in eight files.
