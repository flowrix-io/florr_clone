// The one way an item is drawn, anywhere in the game.
//
// Ported from rysteria_gardn's `draw_loadout_background` and `draw_static_petal`
// (Client/Assets/Petal.cc). gardn has exactly one item renderer: the loadout
// bar, the inventory, the crafting ring, the gallery drop tables and the drops
// lying on the ground are all the same 60x60 cell drawn at different sizes, so
// a petal is instantly recognisable as the same object wherever it appears.
//
// This client used to have four of them -- the loadout bar's gardn-shaped one,
// `itemCell` for the grid panels, the shop's card and the world renderer's
// ground drop -- each with its own plate geometry, its own icon size and its
// own idea of how a multi-petal stack previews. They are all this now.
//
// Everything is laid out in gardn's 60x60 design space centred on the origin
// and scaled by `side / 60`, which is what lets one call serve a 34px crafting
// ring slot and a 70px inventory cell without either being a different design.
