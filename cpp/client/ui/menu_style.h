// The card and the buttons every menu is built from.
//
// A menu in this game is two things: a frame and the controls on it. Both used
// to be re-derived per panel -- seven copies of the same rounded-rect helper,
// three close crosses that differed only in their line cap, and four different
// answers to "what does a panel's edge look like". This file is the one answer.
//
// The frame is the OVERLAY CARD: a rounded rect in the border colour with the
// body inset into it, which is the shape the settings and guild panels were
// already drawing by hand. It is not a stroke. A stroke centres on the path,
// so half of it lands outside the card and the outer corner is cut to
// radius + width/2; the two-fill form keeps the outer radius intact and the
// border reads as a frame the body sits in rather than a line drawn over it.
//
// Nothing here holds state. Layout, hover and press are the caller's business,
// so hit-testing stays with the panel that owns the geometry.
