// Text fields: the selection they hold, the keyboard that edits it and the
// pointer that drags it out.
//
// Every field in the client -- the auth form, the lobby's name box, the chat
// line, the inventory's search, the shop's code box, the guild prompts, the
// settings endpoint and the skin studio's two editors -- grew its own copy of
// "append typedText, erase on Backspace". Seven copies, seven sets of rules
// about what a printable character is, no clipboard, and no selection at all:
// there was nothing in the client a player could drag a highlight across, so
// "copy" could only ever have meant the whole box.
//
// This is the one copy. Nothing here draws -- the field's plate and its scroll
// are still the panel's business -- but everything here is what a panel needs
// to draw a selection correctly: where a byte offset lands in x, and which
// offset an x lands on.
