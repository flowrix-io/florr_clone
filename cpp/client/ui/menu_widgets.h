// The stateful pieces every menu is assembled from.
//
// The card, its headings and every button are in client/ui/menu_style.h --
// pure shape, no state. What is left here is the chrome a panel has to feed
// something to: a toggle's animation, a field's caret, a scrollbar's offset,
// a tooltip's contents. Included from there rather than beside it, so a panel
// that wants the whole toolkit still only names this file.
//
// Nothing here holds state either. Layout is the caller's business, and hover
// and press are passed in rather than tracked, so hit-testing stays with the
// panel that owns the geometry.
