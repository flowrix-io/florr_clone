// The talent tree.
//
// Six branches fan out from the flower, one per stat, each a chain of tiers
// on the rarity ladder. A branch walks outward in equal steps and turns a
// little more with each step past the third, which is what keeps ten nodes
// evenly spaced instead of crossing their neighbours. Second Chance is not a
// branch of its own: it forks off Flower Health at the tier it needs, and says
// so by growing out of that node.
//
// The fan is laid out in fixed pixels and is deliberately far larger than the
// card -- most of it starts off the edge. Dragging spins the whole tree about
// the flower, which is how the rest is reached, and the card clips the excess.
