// Settings.
//
// Four tabs in a fixed 420x500 card pinned under the top icon row: the key
// bindings, the graphics switches and sliders, the server address and the
// account actions, and the credits. Every SWITCH here is local to this client
// and none of them can change what the simulation does -- which is why
// hitboxes can be switched on without it being a cheat. The Advanced tab's
// account block is the exception and the only one: Change Password and Log Out
// are requests to the server, and are marked as such below.
//
// The panel keeps more between frames than SettingsPanel has members for: a
// tab, a press, a slider drag, a focused field, and the switches that have no
// home in ClientSettings yet. That state lives in this file because there is
// exactly one settings panel in the process, so a file-scope instance is the
// same thing as a member.
//
// Which rows reach the rest of the client, and which do not:
//   wired   all fifteen bindings -> ClientSettings, which is what App reads
//           for movement, the petal keys, chat and zoom and what MenuSystem
//           reads for the panel keys and the two in-game switches; Show
//           Hitboxes -> settings.render.hitboxes, Use Mouse Controls ->
//           settings.useMouseControls, Enable Debug Menu button ->
//           settings.showDebugButton, Request Mobile ->
//           settings.requestMobile, which is what App puts the on-screen
//           stick and its two buttons up from. These are read elsewhere and
//           persisted with the rest of ClientSettings.
//   local   every other switch and the mob-framerate slider. The rows are
//           drawn because the reference draws them -- the row set is the
//           panel's shape, not a claim about this client -- but a value
//           cannot outlive the process until ClientSettings carries a field
//           for it to be saved in, so they are remembered for the session and
//           no longer. Number Keys Use Items is the one whose row is real and
//           whose behaviour is not: this client has no "use the petal in a
//           slot" path for the number keys to take, so the switch has nothing
//           to switch yet.
//   inert   Anti-aliasing and GPU Acceleration are not switchable at runtime.
//           The browser build always uses its native Canvas2D backend; the
//           desktop build owns a fixed software canvas plus SDL presentation.
//           The rows keep their value for parity, but nothing reads it. Render
//           Resolution is different: it sizes the backing canvas through
//           Window::setRenderScale and genuinely buys frame rate.
