// How a map is fitted into the minimap's box.
//
// The corner map shows THE WHOLE REALM, not a window onto it. There is one
// map in play at a time and every map says its own size, so the only question
// left is arithmetic: what scale takes a world rectangle into a 200-unit
// square, and where inside that square does it sit.
//
// UNIFORM SCALE, CENTRED. The smaller of the two axis ratios wins, so a map
// that is not square letterboxes -- bars above and below a wide map, either
// side of a tall one -- rather than being stretched into the box. A stretched
// minimap is worse than a small one: a player reads distance and direction off
// it, and neither survives two different scales.
//
// Split out of the minimap painter (client/app_minimap.cpp) because it is the
// part of the minimap that can be checked without painting anything: the fit
// is arithmetic over a rectangle and the solid walk below is a question about
// the map, while everything else in the path is pixels.

/// ONCE EACH. A shape drawn past its tile's edge is filed in every cell it
/// reaches (see ShapeGrid), so walking the grid meets it several times. It
/// cannot be deduplicated on `ownCell` alone: a shape authored WHOLLY outside
/// its tile -- Tiled lets an author drag one there, and the loader warns about
/// it rather than refusing it -- reaches no cell with `ownCell` set, and a
/// ring skipped in every cell it is filed in is a wall drawn nowhere. So the
/// key is the ring's identity instead: the points it was handed (the store's
/// own, never a copy) plus the cell that owns it, which `origin` names.
///
/// PAINT ORDER is layer order, bottom first, with water before wall inside one
/// layer -- the order the map paints them in, and the order the queries resolve
/// a point's KIND in (cellLayerAt gives the kind to the TOPMOST ring holding
/// the point). Painting in any other order colours a river black wherever it
/// crosses a wall layer below it. The whole-cell fallback sits at the top of
/// the stack, because the coarse Tile it comes from is itself the fold of the
