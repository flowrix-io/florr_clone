// Does the CLIENT collide where the server does?
//
// The wire carries one byte per cell, and a cell's collision is not one byte
// any more: it is the shapes the author drew on the tile, which cover a
// triangle, an L or a scatter of rectangles inside their own square cell. So
// the client rebuilds the exact geometry from its own copy of the map and keeps
// the wire's grid as the coarse view -- and the whole point of doing it that
// way is that the two ends then agree exactly, not approximately.
//
// Every test here runs a real server on loopback with a real client on the
// other end of a real socket. The map is a fixture rather than the shipped
// garden, because the assertions are about a KNOWN boundary: a run of diagonal
// wall tiles whose collision shape is the triangle below each one's diagonal,
// which lands the wall exactly on the world line x = y + kTileSize.
