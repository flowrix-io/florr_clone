// The transports available inside a JavaScript runtime, as a byte channel.
//
// Natively, transport.cpp moves bytes with socket(), connect(), accept() and
// recv(). Neither half of an emscripten build can: a browser tab has no TCP,
// and while emscripten can emulate BSD sockets over a WebSocket, that emulation
// offers WebSocket and nothing else. This is the seam that lets the same
// Connection/Listener/Dialer speak whatever the runtime actually has:
//
//   WebTransport   HTTP/3 over QUIC, when the runtime implements it, the page
//                  is a secure context, and the server advertises it. One
//                  bidirectional stream carries everything.
//   WebSocket      always available, and the fallback whenever anything about
//                  the WebTransport attempt does not work out.
//
// Both are presented here as an ordered byte stream, because that is what the
// layer above already expects: transport.cpp's `[u32 length][payload]` framing
// is what finds message boundaries, and it does so identically whether the
// bytes arrived as discrete WebSocket messages or as a QUIC stream that split
// and coalesced them however it liked.
//
// Everything is non-blocking. connect() and listen() return immediately and
// the handshake finishes later; state() is how the caller finds out, polled
// once a frame, because neither runtime lets us block and wait.
