// Framing:   every message is [u32 byteLength][u8 type][payload], little-endian.
// Direction: ClientMessage ids and ServerMessage ids are separate spaces.

// There are no type tags inside a payload -- both sides read the fields a
// message declares, in order. Compatibility is therefore established once, at
// connect time: the client sends kProtocolVersion together with a hash of the
// content it was built against, and a server that disagrees says so plainly
// instead of letting the two sides misread each other's bytes for a session.
