// Length-prefixed message transport over TCP.
//
// One poll() loop drives every connection. At this game's scale -- a few
// hundred sockets on one listener -- poll() costs less than the complexity of
// keeping an epoll and a kqueue path honest, and it is the same code on Linux
// and macOS.
//
// Both sides speak the same framing: [u32 length][payload]. Reads accumulate
// until a whole frame is present; writes queue and drain as the socket allows,
// so a slow client backs up in its own buffer instead of blocking the tick.
//
// There are two backends under all of this, and only the byte movement differs
// -- the framing, the backlog rule and the TransportHandler contract are one
// implementation shared by both:
//
//   native       a TCP socket and poll(), as described above.
//   emscripten   whatever the JavaScript runtime has, via net/web_channel.h:
//                WebTransport when the runtime and the server both offer it,
//                WebSocket otherwise. `fd()` there is a channel handle rather
//                than a descriptor, and poll()'s timeout is ignored, because
//                neither a browser tab nor a Node event loop may be blocked.
