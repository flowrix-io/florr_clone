//
// Everything hangs off one registry, Module.flixNet, whose slots hold either a
// channel or a listener. Slot indices are the handles C++ passes around, so a
// closed channel's slot is nulled rather than spliced out -- reusing an index
// for something else while C++ still holds it would be the one bug this design
// can have.
//
// A listener is one of two things, decided by what the runtime is. Under Node
// it is a real HTTP(S) server with a WebSocket upgrade path -- the deployed
// game server. In a page it is an in-page listener: a port number that
// connect() calls from the SAME page resolve to directly, handing the two ends
// a pair of queues instead of a socket. That is what lets one wasm carry both
// halves of the game and play them against each other with no network at all
// (offline/main.cpp); the Listener and Dialer above cannot tell the difference,
