// Player-only visual flags shared by simulation, snapshots and rendering.
//
// All three travel on the wire in every Player record, and renderFlags is also
// persisted in the account database, so never renumber a value. (They began as
// a mirror of src/player.ts; see git history.) They are deliberately separate
// from the generic EntityState bits: EntityState is transient simulation
// state, while these describe the flower body and its cosmetics.
