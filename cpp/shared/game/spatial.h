// The broadphase: a uniform bucket grid per realm, rebuilt from scratch every
// tick.
//
// Everything that asks "what is near me" -- contact damage, petal hits,
// projectile tests, mob aggro, drop pickup -- asks it here first. Rebuilding
// beats maintaining: in a world where nearly every entity moves every tick, an
// incremental structure spends more time on removals and re-insertions than a
// full rebuild costs, and it can go wrong. This cannot.
//
// Results are CANDIDATES. A query returns every entity whose inserted
// footprint shares a cell with the queried region, which is a superset of the
// entities that actually overlap it; the caller does the exact test, because
// the caller is the one that knows whether it wants circles, capsules or a
// cone. What the grid guarantees is that the superset is complete and that
// nothing appears in it twice.
//
// One LAYER per realm (see realm.h). The overworld, the arena and the maze
// are separate coordinate spaces whose positions overlap numerically, so an
// entity is filed under its realm and a query names the realm it is asking
// about. A candidate list therefore never crosses realms, and no caller has
// to remember to check -- a maze mob at (3000, 3000) is simply not in the
// grid an overworld flower at (3000, 3000) queries.
