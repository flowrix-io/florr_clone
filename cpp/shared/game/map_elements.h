// The map's annotations: spawn zones, biomes and teleporters.
//
// `map_bundle.ts` carries two things. The tile grid, which Terrain already
// reads, says what is solid. MAP_ELEMENTS says what the map MEANS -- which
// stretch of ground is the beginner's field, which rectangle is the desert,
// which tier of mob belongs where. Terrain deliberately knows none of that:
// geometry and meaning are separate questions, and only one of them is needed
// per tick.
//
// This exists because a player has to spawn somewhere sane. Dropping them at
// the centre of the world puts them in the middle of the legendary and mythic
// bands, which is a place a level-1 flower cannot survive and cannot walk out
// of. The map already says where the common ground is; this reads it.
