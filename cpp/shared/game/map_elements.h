#pragma once
// The map's annotations: spawn bands, player spawn points and teleporters --
// and the ART the client draws the map with.
//
// A map file carries three things. The tile layers the author painted, whose
// COLLISION Terrain derives and whose PICTURES this file carries through for
// the renderer. And the object layers, which say what the map MEANS -- which
// stretch of ground grows which mobs, where a joining player is put down, and
// which pad leads to which other map. Terrain deliberately knows none of the
// last two: geometry and meaning are separate questions, and only one of them
// is needed per tick.
//
// The art rides here rather than over the wire on purpose. Every client
// already loads every staged map for its annotations, and the pictures are the
// one part of a map that is not authoritative -- what is solid comes from the
// server, what it looks like comes from the file both ends ship.
//
// There is one MapData per world map, and WorldMaps at the bottom of this file
// owns them all. Every realm that is not the arena or the maze has exactly one
// of each -- one tile grid inside Terrain, one MapData here -- and the realm
// id is the index that ties them together.
