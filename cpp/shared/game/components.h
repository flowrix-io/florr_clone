// Every component in the game.
//
// Two rules shape this list:
//
//  * A component is what an entity HAS, not what it is allowed to do. Systems
//    are selected by which components an entity carries, so "can be damaged"
//    is a Health component and not a flag inside a giant Actor struct.
//
//  * State that toggles frequently lives in a FIELD, not in its own tag.
//    Adding or removing a component moves the entity between archetypes, which
//    copies all of its data. Tags are reserved for what an entity fundamentally
//    is -- and that changes at most once in its lifetime.
