// The tile world.
//
// A 200x200 grid of Tile over the 60000-unit map; constants.h owns both
// numbers. Terrain answers three questions and nothing else: what is at a
// point, where does a circle end up once it is out of the walls, and is there
// a clear straight line between two points.
//
// Every accessor is TOTAL: a read outside the grid answers Tile::Wall. That is
// what closes the world -- no system special-cases the map edge, it is simply
// wall all the way out -- and it means resolveCircle keeps a body inside the
// map without a single bounds check of its own.
