// The tile world.
//
// One grid of Tile per world realm, 256 units a tile; constants.h owns the
// tile size, the map file owns the dimensions. Terrain answers three questions
// and nothing else: what is at a point, where does a circle end up once it is
// out of the walls, and is there a clear straight line between two points.
//
// Every accessor is TOTAL: a read outside the grid answers Tile::Wall. That is
// what closes the world -- no system special-cases the map edge, it is simply
// wall all the way out -- and it means resolveCircle keeps a body inside the
// map without a single bounds check of its own.
//
// A CELL IS THE SHAPES ITS TILE CARRIES, not its square. The author draws
// collision in Tiled's Tile Collision Editor, per tile, and a cell contributes
// those shapes turned by its flip bits and scaled onto the cell -- so a body
// walks up to the edge the art draws and stops there. Terrain keeps two views
// of that, and the difference between them matters at every call site:
//
//   the COARSE grid   one Tile per cell: does this cell hold ANY blocking
//                     shape, and of what kind. What the minimap paints, what
//                     the bots' flow field walks, what spawn placement rejects
//                     conservatively, and the only thing that travels over the
//                     wire.
//   the SHAPES        the exact geometry, per realm, beside the grid. What
//                     blocked(), resolveWall(), resolveCircle(), the segment
//                     tests, hasLineOfSight() and inWater() answer from.
//
// A realm with no shape store -- a generated map, a grid a test wrote with
// setTile(), a client whose data directory has no map for the realm it is in --
// falls back to the whole 256-unit square of every blocking cell, which is the
// old behaviour and is conservative: it blocks a little more than the art does,
// never less.
//
// A layer may also REMOVE collision: `negate_collision` cancels, where it has
// a tile, what the layers below it contributed (tiled_map.h). That is a
// bridge, and it is RESOLVED WHEN THE STORE IS BUILT -- the cancelled shapes
// are never filed -- so both views above answer it without knowing it
// happened, and a decked cell is Ground in the coarse grid, empty in the shape
// store and dry to inWater(). The one case that survives into a query is a
// negating tile whose shapes cover only PART of its cell, which is the one
// thing this cannot resolve away and the one the load report warns about; see
// ShapeGrid::Ref::negates.
//
// What a cell LOOKS like is not here at all: the artwork is the map file's
// layers (tiled_map.h), which the client reads for itself.
