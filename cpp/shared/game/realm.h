// Realms: the game's separate coordinate systems.
//
// The overworld, the PVP arena and the daily maze are three different places,
// and each one has its own coordinate space with its own origin at (0, 0). An
// entity carries WHICH space its position is in (Transform::realm), and nothing
// in one realm can see, touch, target, push or pick up anything in another:
// the broadphase keeps one grid per realm, replication only streams a viewer
// its own realm, and every terrain question is asked about a realm.
//
// The reference put the arena at (150000, 150000) and the maze at
// (200000, 200000) inside ONE world space, and lived with what that costs: a
// world clamp that drags a maze body back to the map's edge unless every
// clamp remembers the exception, a section lookup that answers nonsense for
// a far-off point, a minimap that has nothing to draw, f32 positions on the
// wire losing precision past 2^17, and a broadphase whose border cells collect
// everything outside the map. Separate spaces make all of that structurally
// impossible rather than individually guarded against.
