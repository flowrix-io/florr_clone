# florr C++ — architecture

A clean-sheet C++ rewrite. The TypeScript tree in `src/` is a **behavioural
reference only**: it says what the game feels like and what its data files
mean. None of its structure, workarounds or defects carry across.

What is deliberately kept:

* **Gameplay style** — a flower with an orbiting ring of petals, attack/defend,
  tiered mobs, loot that drops and is absorbed into an inventory, crafting up
  the rarity ladder.
* **UI style** — the flat, rounded, high-contrast look: thick dark outlines,
  rarity-coloured panels, chunky text with a stroked outline.
* **`src/mobs.json` and `src/petals.json`** — loaded verbatim, including the
  inline SVG artwork.
* **`inventory.json`** — the account database, read and written in the same
  JSON shape.

What is deliberately *not* kept: the wire protocol, the entity model, the
rendering stack, the DOM. **There is no HTML and no CSS anywhere in this
project.** The client is a native SDL2 application and every pixel of it —
title screen, login form, HUD, inventory, chat — is drawn through the
`cpp_canvas` 2D API.

## The ECS

`shared/core/world.h`. Archetype storage: entities with the same component set
share contiguous per-component columns.

```cpp
World world;
Entity e = world.create();
world.add<Transform>(e, Transform{{100, 200}, 0.0});
world.add<Health>(e, Health{50, 100});

Query<Transform, Motion> movers{world};      // build ONCE, reuse every tick
movers.each([&](Entity e, Transform& t, Motion& m) {
    t.position += m.velocity * dt;
});
```

Rules that matter:

* **Build queries once**, as a member of the system. Constructing one per tick
  throws away the archetype cache that makes iteration free.
* **Never create or destroy an entity inside `each`.** Column pointers are live
  during iteration. Record the intent in a `CommandBuffer` and let the runtime
  flush it between phases.
* **Frequently-toggled state is a field, not a tag.** Adding or removing a
  component relocates the entity and copies all of its data. `Dead` is a tag
  because an entity dies once; "is currently poisoned" is a field on
  `Afflictions` because it changes constantly.
* Component structs live in `shared/game/components.h` and are registered with
  `FLIX_COMPONENT(...)` at global scope. Add new ones there, not locally.

## Simulation

Fixed **25 Hz** (`net::kTicksPerSecond`). The server never varies its step.

Phase order, once per tick — later phases may rely on earlier ones having run:

1. **Input** — drain client input into `PlayerInput`.
2. **Intent** — AI decides targets and headings; player input becomes a desired
   velocity.
3. **Movement** — integrate velocity under friction, resolve tiles, apply and
   decay knockback.
4. **Rings** — petals are placed on their owner's ring.
5. **Combat** — contact damage, petal hits, projectiles, afflictions.
6. **Lifecycle** — deaths, XP and loot awards, drops, despawns, spawning.
7. **Replication** — build and send each client's snapshot.
8. **Flush** — apply the tick's `CommandBuffer`.

Deaths mark `Dead` rather than destroying, so everything later in the same tick
still sees the entity. The reaper destroys them in phase 8.

## Realms

`shared/game/realm.h`. The overworld, the PVP arena and the daily maze are
three **separate coordinate spaces**, each with its own origin at (0, 0). Every
`Transform` carries the `Realm` its position is in, copied from whatever
spawned the entity: a petal from its flower, a drop from its mob, a shot from
its shooter, a nest's escort from the nest.

The reference put the arena at (150000, 150000) and the maze at
(200000, 200000) inside one world space and guarded every clamp, section
lookup and grid individually. Here nothing in one realm can reach another by
construction:

* **Terrain** answers per realm. `Terrain::blocked/inWater/resolveCircle/
  segmentBlocked/hasLineOfSight/findOpenSpawn` all take a `Realm` (no default,
  on purpose): the overworld is the map's authored collision shapes -- the
  polygons and rectangles each tile carries in Tiled, placed per cell from
  every layer marked `has_collision` and cancelled under a layer marked
  `negate_collision` (a bridge deck, resolved once at load so that every view
  agrees), with the one-value-per-cell tile grid
  kept beside them as the coarse view the flow field and the fast reject use
  (the minimap draws the shapes themselves, through
  `Terrain::collisionRingsAt`, because a coarse cell paints a tunnel shut) --
  the maze is `activeMaze()`'s corridor lattice, and the arena is open floor
  inside a ring.
  `Terrain::clampInside` is the realm's closure — the world rectangle, the
  maze square, or the ring's inside face — and replaces the old world clamp.
* **Broadphase** — `SpatialGrid` keeps one layer per realm; `insert` files an
  entity under its realm and `query` names the realm it asks about, so a
  candidate list never crosses. The movement system's separation grid and the
  petal attraction grid are the same class and follow the same rule.
* **Replication** streams a viewer only its own realm, squadmates included;
  positional events carry a realm and are filtered the same way.
* **Player lists** are `RealmPoint`s (position + realm): the mob LOD gate, the
  spawn census and the separation gate all pair a mob only with flowers in
  its own space.
* **Population** — `SpawnSystem` stocks the **spawn bands** the map's author
  drew on it, and nothing else. A band owns a population of its own, sized by
  its outline's area (`kTargetMobDensity`), topped up while a player can see
  it; ground no band covers grows nothing, ever, and a map with no band on it
  is empty and says so on its load line (`NO SPAWN BANDS`). `maps/README.md`
  has the format. The one mob that stands on unbanded ground is a child laid
  out on a ring around its parent — a nest's escorts, a centipede's body — and
  the parent is inside a band.
  `ModeSpawner` (`server/systems/mode_spawning.*`) fills the arena (a crowd
  that scales with the duellists, garden roster plus spider) and the maze
  (`kTargetMobDensity` again, a stocked band's density across every corridor,
  depth-zone tiers, two ultra bosses in the deepest rooms) whole, while anyone
  is inside; the census keeps those mobs alive on the same condition and drains
  them afterwards. Those two realms are generated rather than authored — there
  is no object layer to draw a band on — so they are deliberately exempt from
  the rule above.
* **Joining** — the spawn picker's `"pvp"` and `"maze"` are realm choices, not
  biomes. `JoinAccepted` carries the realm and the maze day; `MazeInfo`
  restates the day when `change-maze` rotates it. The client builds the same
  walls from the day alone and draws the ground the realm calls for (tiles,
  maze walls, or the arena ring), the maze minimap, and the arena scoreboard.
* **The arena run** plays on a scratch `PlayerRecord` (`Session::arena`):
  starter ring, empty bag, no talents, flat 100 health, players hostile to
  each other (`Faction::friendlyFireEnabled`), XP earned doubling as
  `ArenaScore`. `GameServer::liveRecord` is what every inventory and loadout
  handler reads, so the account is never touched by a run; a quarter of the
  run's loot reaches the account when the body leaves, and a death hands the
  run to the killer.
* **The maze track** — a maze body plays the account's loadout one rarity down
  (orbiting slots still above mythic are benched), locked for the run, and its
  XP and talents are `PlayerRecord::mazeTotalXp` / `mazeSkills`, never the
  outside level.

## Networking

`shared/net/`. `[u32 length][u8 type][payload]`, little-endian, no type tags
inside a payload. Over TCP natively and over WebSocket or WebTransport in an
emscripten build -- see Transports below; the framing is the same either way. `protocol.h` is the single source of truth for message
ids and field order; both sides read it.

* `Listener` (server) and `Dialer` (client) both drive a `poll()` loop and hand
  whole frames to a `TransportHandler`.
* A malformed length prefix drops the connection; a truncated frame yields a
  zeroed message the handler discards. Neither can corrupt state.
* Snapshots are per-client and viewport-scoped. An entity entering view is sent
  once as a spawn record (kind, type, rarity, name); afterwards only the fields
  in its `UpdateFields` mask.
* `NetId` is a never-reused u32, distinct from `Entity`, so a client that missed
  a removal cannot apply an update to the wrong thing.

## Client prediction

The client runs `integrateVelocity` from `shared/game/constants.h` — literally
the same function the server runs. It keeps unacknowledged inputs in a ring,
and on each snapshot snaps to the authoritative position and replays the inputs
the server has not yet acknowledged. In open movement the two agree exactly and
nothing visibly corrects. Remote entities are interpolated one snapshot behind.

## Touch

A phone gets the same client, with three things added to it.

**The mirrored pointer.** `Window` turns the first contact down into the left
mouse button — position, press and release. Every panel, button and drag in
the client is written against `mousePressed`/`mouseDown`, and none of them
learns the difference. A finger that stays down keeps the pointer; a second
one is ignored rather than teleporting it.

**The claimed contacts.** An on-screen stick cannot be one mouse: it has to
track a finger while another holds a button. `Window::setTouchClaimHandler` is
asked the instant a contact lands, and a claimed one is kept out of the mirror
entirely — otherwise dragging the stick would drag the pointer across the HUD
underneath. `client/ui/mobile_controls.*` is what claims them: a virtual stick
that moves and aims, and Attack/Retract standing in for the two keys. It is a
port of the browser build's `src/graphics/mobile-controls.ts`, with every size
multiplied by the design units a CSS pixel is worth on a phone (see the file's
header) and shrunk further on a viewport too narrow to lay the three out side
by side.

They come up on a coarse pointer without being asked, and the Settings panel's
**Request Mobile** row is what overrules that in either direction
(`ClientSettings::touchControlsWanted`). `--mobile` forces them for a
screenshot run, which is the only way a desktop window shows them.

**The keyboard.** A canvas takes no keyboard focus, so a phone browser opens
no keyboard for one however many text fields are painted on it. The web build
keeps an invisible `<input>` that IS focusable, and focusing it summons the
keyboard; the keystrokes bubble to the window, where the client's own key
handler already listens.

Two rules make that focus actually work on a phone, and both are easy to get
wrong because a desktop browser's touch emulation forgives either:

* It happens on **`click`**, not on `touchstart`. A browser only raises its
  keyboard for a focus made from a real gesture, and `click` is the event
  every one of them honours. (The browser build focuses its own hidden input
  from exactly there, which is the evidence this follows.)
* The tap that asks for a keyboard is the one gesture the window does **not**
  `preventDefault`. A consumed touch produces no click at all, and a browser
  will not raise its keyboard off a touch it was told to ignore. The mouse
  events the page then synthesises from that gesture are dropped instead
  (`Impl::ghostUntilMillis`) because the mirror already delivered them —
  without that, a field tap lands twice, which the field's own click-streak
  logic reads as a double-click.

Deciding this inside the gesture is a frame earlier than any client code runs,
so every field records its box as it is painted or hit-tested
(`ui::TextFieldRegions`), the window is handed the set at the end of the
frame, and the touch and click handlers answer from it.

## Rendering

`third_party/cpp_canvas`, a Canvas2D-shaped API (`save`/`restore`,
`translate`/`rotate`/`scale`, paths, `fill`/`stroke`, `fillText`,
`drawCanvas`). `SvgDocument::fromString()` compiles the SVG strings in
`mobs.json` / `petals.json` into canvas calls — that is how mob and petal
artwork survives the rewrite intact.

Draw order per frame: terrain → ground effects → drops → mobs → petals →
players → floating damage → HUD → panels → cursor.

## The web build

`emcmake cmake` builds the client AND the server for a JavaScript runtime:

```
mkdir cpp/build-web && cd cpp/build-web
emcmake cmake .. -DFLIX_BUILD=release
cmake --build . -j8      # -> bundle.{html,js,wasm}, server.{js,wasm}
```

`npm run build` at the repository root does the same thing and then stages the
result in `dist/`, which is what ships: `scripts/build-web.js` configures and
builds both web targets and copies them out. `npm start` is that build followed
by running it, so what it serves is never a half-stale `dist/`. Both pin
`FLIX_BUILD=release` rather than letting the environment decide — they are the
commands that produce what ships. `npm run build:dev` is the dev-flavoured
build, and `npm run start_nobuild` runs whatever is already staged. Switching
flavour deletes `cpp/build-web` first: the Makefile generator does not make an
object depend on the flags it was compiled with, so reconfiguring in place would
relink the previous flavour's objects with the new flavour's name on them.
The web build's outputs carry the names the TypeScript build's did
— the page's script is `bundle.js` and the server is `server.js` — so nginx,
pm2 and the autoupdate zipball did not have to learn new ones; `bundle.html` is
staged as `dist/index.html`. Only the web build is renamed, at the link, by
`OUTPUT_NAME` in CMakeLists.txt: the native binaries are still `flowrix_client`
and `flowrix_server`.

The two files the page downloads are staged deflated as well, as
`bundle.js.bin` and `bundle.wasm.bin`: `compress()` in `scripts/build-web.js`
writes them, and the loader in `client/web/shell.html` prefers them, inflating
them with the browser's own `DecompressionStream` and handing the wasm
straight to `compileStreaming` so that the module still compiles while it is
arriving. It takes what a first visit downloads from 4.5MB to 1.1MB. This is
the browser client's scheme carried over — `scripts/compressbundle.js`
deflated its `bundle.js` into `bundle.bin` and the page inflated it the same
way — extended to the wasm, which is where the bytes are now. The
uncompressed files still ship and are still what the loader falls back to: a
build served straight out of `cpp/build-web` has no `.bin` beside it, because
compressing is a staging step and not part of the link, and
`DecompressionStream` is missing from browsers older than 2023. The two
copies of one artifact have to travel together, though — a `.bin` from an
older build than the file beside it is a page that loads yesterday's client.

`-DFLIX_BUILD` picks the flavour, and is the only build knob: `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`
follows from it rather than being set alongside it.

* **`dev`** (cmake's default; the npm scripts pin `release`) — `-O2 -g`, `assert()` live, frame pointers kept, and
  emscripten's own heap and stack checks on. The native client remains
  optimised because its CPU rasterizer is not useful at `-O0`; the web client
  always delegates drawing and compositing to the browser's Canvas2D backend.
  The web link is left at the configuration's own `-O2 -g`, because wasm-opt
  at `-O3` is most of the wait on a relink.
* **`release`** — `-O3`, `NDEBUG`, no debug info, emscripten's checks off, and
  the client's web link pinned at `-O3` whatever else is on the line. About 2MB
  of wasm against dev's 19MB.

Both are the same programs as the native ones — the same tick and the same
systems issuing the same Canvas-shaped draw list. The native build consumes
that list with its software rasterizer; Emscripten sends every draw, offscreen
blit, text run, and composite operation to browser Canvas2D. It never allocates
the software framebuffer in Wasm. The builds otherwise differ in three places.

* **Who owns the loop.** Natively `App::run()` and `GameServer::run()` do. In a
  page the event loop belongs to the browser, and under Node it belongs to
  Node; either way, blocking it is exactly what would stop every message from
  ever being delivered. So both `main.cpp`s hand `step()` to
  `emscripten_set_main_loop_arg` and return.

* **What carries the bytes.** See below. The framing does not change:
  `[u32 length][u8 type][payload]` is what finds message boundaries, and it
  does so identically whether the bytes arrived as discrete WebSocket messages
  or as a QUIC stream that split and coalesced them however it liked.

* **Where the content lives.** `--embed-file`, not `--preload-file`: mobs.json,
  petals.json, the maps with their tilesets and tile art, the title screen's
  ground SVGs and the fonts are inside the wasm. The client reads all of them synchronously during `start()`, so there
  is nothing to gain from a fetch it would have to wait for; a single artifact
  cannot half-deploy the way a `.wasm` and a stale `.data` beside it can; and
  the server has no page to run a preload from at all.

`client/web/shell.html` is the page. It does no rendering and picks no
transport: it sizes nothing, fetches the glue and the wasm (compressed, as
above), hands the wasm the canvas element and the argv `main()` would have had
natively, and gets out of the way. It defaults to its
own origin, so an untouched URL already points at the server that served it;
`?host=`/`?port=` are only for a client build hosted somewhere else.

## Serving the client

The wasm server serves it, over the same port it plays the game on:

```
node cpp/build-web/server.js --port 4242 --db inventory.json
# -> https://localhost:4242/
```

`npm start` is this, pointed at the staged build instead: `node dist/server.js
--port ${PORT:-3000} --db dist/inventory.json --web-root dist`, run from the
repository root so that the certificate lookup finds `cert.crt` / `dev-cert.crt`
where they live.

One process and one origin for the page, the WebSocket, the QUIC listener and
`/transport-info`. Nothing else has to be running, and the page is same-origin
with its server — which is what a secure context needs before WebTransport is
possible at all.

It follows the TypeScript server here, because the two share these files:

* **HTTPS when there is a certificate.** `--cert`/`--key` name it; with
  neither, `cert.crt` then `dev-cert.crt` are looked for in the working
  directory. **Validity decides, not order** — the committed `cert.crt`
  outlives its own dates while the generated dev pair is refreshed, and
  serving the dead one would cost every browser the connection and cost
  WebTransport its pinnable digest. Finding nothing serves plain HTTP, and
  WebSocket is then the only transport on offer.
* An expired certificate is **reported, not regenerated**. `npm start` owns
  that file; two writers is how they come to disagree.
* `--web-root` is the directory served, defaulting to the build directory the
  server module was loaded from — which is where the client build already is.
  `/` serves `index.html` or `bundle.html`. Requests are decoded,
  normalised and required to stay under the root, and `.wasm` is served as
  `application/wasm` so the browser will stream-compile it.

**The server's exit code says whether it wants to come back.** An ordinary
shutdown — a signal, `npm start` interrupted — exits 0. A `restart`, and the
restart `update` schedules once its install lands, exit **1**: pm2's
`stop_exit_codes` and systemd's `Restart=on-failure` both read 0 as "this
process was meant to end" and leave a cleanly-exited server down, which turns
a restart into a shutdown with a countdown and nothing coming to undo it.
`GameServer::exitCode()` carries which of the two it was out of the loop, and
`server/main.cpp` returns it — natively as the process's status, and under
Node through `process.exit`, because a Node that merely runs out of work
exits 0.

## The offline build

The third web target is the whole game in one file:

```
cmake --build cpp/build-web --target flowrix_offline   # -> offline.html
npm run build:offline                                  # the same, staged as dist/offline.html
```

`offline.html` opens from disk — double-click it, or `file:///…/offline.html`
— with no server running and no network. It is not a third program:
`offline/main.cpp` starts the shipping `GameServer` and the shipping `App` in
one wasm and steps both from one `requestAnimationFrame` callback, the server
first so that this frame's input is simulated before this frame is drawn. The
two talk over the same `Listener`/`Dialer` pair as the network build, over the
in-page loopback described under Transports. Bots, the maze, squads, the
console commands — everything the server does, it does here, for one player.

What makes it one file is `-sSINGLE_FILE`: the wasm is embedded in the script
and the script in the page, so nothing is fetched. That is the whole
requirement — a page opened from a `file://` URL may not fetch a `.wasm` beside
itself — and it is also why the page references nothing else: no stylesheet,
no favicon, and no Google Fonts. The Ubuntu faces embedded in the wasm for
measuring are registered with the document (`FontFace`) at startup, so text is
drawn in the same bytes it was measured with. The file is a few megabytes, and
`dist/offline.html` is gitignored so a rebuild does not land in every commit of
the otherwise committed `dist/`.

State lives in the browser's localStorage, under the `flowrix-offline/` prefix
so that a copy of the page served from the game's own origin never presents the
online client's session token to a server that has never heard of it:

* the client's settings and session token, through the same
  localStorage-backed WasmFS mount the online client uses
  (`client/web/persist.cpp`);
* the account database, mirrored **by path** (`restoreFile`/`mirrorFile` in
  the same file): copied back into memory before the server opens it, compared
  against storage once a second and written when it changed, and flushed from
  the page's unload handler along with every playing account
  (`GameServer::persistAll`). It cannot share the mount, because the mount
  pairs a storage key with the file object it created and the database is
  written atomically — a temp file renamed over the old one — so every save
  would be a new object the mount has no name for.

A scheduled `restart` is honoured the way a process restart would be: the
page reloads, which is "the same build, started fresh". `update` answers that
there is nothing to install into. Without storage (a private window) both
halves still run and simply forget, as the online client does.

One thing this page has that no other build does: **Grant Admin**, in
Settings > Advanced. The server is in the player's own tab and the world is
nobody else's, so the console is theirs to take; the alternative is editing an
account out of browser storage by hand. The button calls
`GameServer::grantAdmin` directly, in-process, through `AppConfig::grantAdmin`
— a hook only `offline/main.cpp` sets. Nothing on the wire carries the grant,
so a client dialling a real server draws no button and the shipping server
gains no way to hand itself the console. What it sets is the permanent
`Account::admin` flag (not the one-life loan `/admin grant_admin` lends), and
the server answers by resending the skin catalog, whose leading flag is where
a client learns its own standing.

### Without WebAssembly

```
cmake --build cpp/build-web --target flowrix_offline_asmjs  # -> offline-asmjs.html
npm run build:offline:asmjs                                 # staged as dist/offline-asmjs.html
```

The same page for a browser with no wasm engine — an old one, or one where it
is switched off. `-sWASM=0` runs the linked module through wasm2js, which
rewrites it into the JavaScript the asm.js era compiled to, and the glue
carries a `WebAssembly` shim of its own so nothing reaches for the engine's.
Everything else is the link the wasm page uses, stated once in
`FLIX_OFFLINE_LINK_OPTIONS` so the two cannot drift into different programs.

Two differences that are not optional:

* **no `-msimd128`.** wasm2js cannot translate SIMD, and the link fails if
  `-flto`'s codegen emits any. Nothing here writes intrinsics, so this costs
  the autovectoriser and nothing else.
* **not in `all`.** wasm2js re-codegens the whole module, which takes minutes,
  so the target is `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL` and built by name.

The page it produces is around 8.5MB against the wasm page's 6MB, and slower
to start and to run. That is the trade for playing where wasm cannot.

## Transports

`shared/net/web_channel.h` is the seam. Natively `transport.cpp` moves bytes
with `socket()`, `connect()`, `accept()` and `recv()`; a browser tab has none
of those, and emscripten's BSD-socket emulation offers WebSocket and nothing
else. So the emscripten build asks this layer for whatever the runtime has:

| | native | emscripten (Node server, page client) | emscripten (offline page) |
|---|---|---|---|
| client → server | TCP | WebTransport, else WebSocket | in-page loopback |
| server listens on | TCP | WebSocket, plus WebTransport with a certificate | an in-page port |

The loopback is what the offline build plays over. A `listen()` in a page —
where there is nothing to bind and nobody outside to serve — registers an
in-page listener under its port, and a `connect()` from the same page to
`127.0.0.1` or `localhost` on that port is resolved to it directly: the two
ends are made together as a pair of queues, each one's `send` feeding the
other's receive queue, both open at once. Any other host still goes over the
network, so the Advanced Settings field can point the offline client at a real
server. Under Node the same `listen()` is a real HTTP(S) server and nothing
below changes.

Between a page client and a Node server the choice is made per connection, by
the client, while it connects:

1. `GET /transport-info` asks the server what it offers. No answer means
   WebSocket, which is the safe assumption anyway.
2. WebTransport is attempted only if the runtime implements it, the page is a
   secure context (the API requires it), and the server said yes. A
   development certificate that no public CA vouches for is pinned by the
   `certHashes` digest the server publishes, which is what makes it work on
   localhost with no trust-store setup.
3. Anything at all going wrong — no UDP path, an untrusted certificate, a
   timeout — falls through to WebSocket. One wasted round trip is the whole
   cost of trying, and it is paid once: the failure is remembered per origin
   in `sessionStorage` for the life of the tab, so a reconnect goes straight
   to WebSocket. That matters behind a proxy that carries only TCP —
   Cloudflare's, for one — where the server still advertises WebTransport on
   its own port and the handshake can never succeed.

The page dials the port it was served on: `location.port`, or the scheme's
default when the URL names none. Behind nginx or Cloudflare that is 443,
which the proxy forwards to the server's own port; only a page with no origin
port at all falls back to 3000.

The server's QUIC listener is equally best-effort: `@fails-components/webtransport`
is an optional native dependency and needs a certificate, and failing either
costs the deployment WebTransport and nothing else. Without a certificate the
listener is plain HTTP and WebSocket only, because WebTransport is
secure-context only and there would be nothing to offer — see Serving the
client above for how one is found.

Only `Connection`'s byte movement and `poll()` differ between the backends.
The framing, the frame loop, the backlog rule and the conditions that end a
connection are one implementation — `Listener::service()` — shared by all of
them, because a copy of those rules per backend is how they would come to
differ in more.

**The two pairs do not interoperate.** A native client speaks TCP and a wasm
server speaks WebSocket; neither knows the other's transport. That is a
deployment choice, not an accident: giving the native build a WebSocket client
would mean carrying an HTTP upgrade and a frame codec in C++ for a case that
has not come up.

## Chat markup

Chat content is not plain text on the wire. The server sends
`<b style="color: #2bffa4;">A super crab has spawned!</b>` and joins multi-line
answers with `<br/>`. `client/ui/markup.h` parses that subset into styled runs;
the transcript in `App::drawChat` lays those out rather than splitting the raw
string on spaces, which used to print the tags.

* `b`, `strong`, `i`, `em`, `u`, `blink`, `span`, `font`, `color` and `br` are
  honoured in every build. There is no italic face, so `<i>` is sheared, the
  way a browser synthesises a missing one.
* `<a>` needs somewhere to navigate, so it is honoured only under
  `FLIX_WEB_BUILD` and dropped — with its content, as any unknown tag is —
  natively. `<img>` is dropped everywhere: the transcript is glyph outlines,
  not elements.
* **`script` and `iframe` are dropped with their content in every build.** The
  old browser client offered a "click to run" button for one and a "click to
  show embed" button for the other. Nothing here reinstates either, and no code
  path in this client executes or embeds what a chat line asks it to. If you
  are adding a tag, that is the line not to cross.

## Style

Match the surrounding code:

* C++17. `snake_case` files, `PascalCase` types, `camelCase` functions and
  variables, `kCamelCase` constants.
* Comment *why*, not *what*. A comment earns its place by explaining a
  non-obvious decision, an invariant, or a trap. No banner comments restating
  a function's name.
* No exceptions in the tick path. Bad input is clamped or dropped, never thrown.
* Tests go in `cpp/tests/`, use `tests/test.h` (`TEST`, `CHECK`, `CHECK_EQ`,
  `CHECK_NEAR`), and must cover the edge cases — not just the happy path.
* Never introduce HTML, CSS, or a DOM dependency.
