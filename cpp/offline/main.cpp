// The offline build: the whole game in one page, with no server to reach.
//
// The same two programs as always -- server/main.cpp and client/main.cpp --
// but linked into ONE wasm and started together, so a single HTML file opened
// from disk is a complete game. Nothing here is a third implementation of
// anything: GameServer and App are the shipping objects, and they talk to each
// other over the same Listener/Dialer pair the network build uses. What is
// different is underneath them, and it is small:
//
//   * The transport. In a page, net/web_channel.cpp keeps an in-page listener
//     per port and resolves a connect() to 127.0.0.1 straight to it, handing
//     the two ends a pair of queues instead of a socket. The server listens on
//     its port as usual, the client dials as usual, and neither can tell.
//
//   * Who owns the loop. Both halves hand their step() to the browser: one
//     requestAnimationFrame callback steps the server, then the client. The
//     server first, so the input the client sent last frame is simulated
//     before this frame is drawn, and the snapshot that tick produced is what
//     this frame shows -- one frame of latency, the same as the loopback pair
//     would have on a native machine.
//
//   * Where the state goes. The page cannot write files, so the account
//     database is mirrored to browser storage by path (see client/web/persist.h
//     for why it cannot share the client's mount), restored before the server
//     opens it, and flushed when the page goes away. The client's settings and
//     session token use their own localStorage-backed mount, as the online
//     client does, under a prefix of their own.
//
//   * The fonts. The online page loads Ubuntu from Google Fonts; this one has
//     nowhere to load from, so the faces embedded in the wasm for measuring
//     are registered with the document for drawing too, and text is set in
//     the same bytes it was measured with.
//
// One thing this build offers that the others do not: a Grant Admin button in
// Settings > Advanced. The server is in this page and the world is nobody
// else's, so the console is the player's to take -- and the alternative is
// hand-editing an account out of browser storage. It calls
// GameServer::grantAdmin directly, in-process; no message carries the grant,
// which is why the shipping server gains no way in from a socket.
//
// A scheduled `restart` is honoured the way a process restart would be: the
// page reloads. Everything that matters is in storage by then, and a reload
// is exactly "the same build, started fresh", which is what the command means.
